## ⚠️ Important Warning – Ad Blockers & Private DNS

🚫 **Do NOT enable Private DNS or DNS-based ad-blocking services** (such as AdGuard DNS, NextDNS, Blokada, etc.).

### Why is this important?
- The app depends on network requests that may be blocked by ad blockers or Private DNS.
- Enabling these services can prevent content from loading.

If any ad blocker or Private DNS is detected or active:
- The app may not load properly
- Videos may fail to play
- Certain features may stop working
- **You may be unable to use the app at all**

### Recommendation
Before opening the app:
1. Disable any ad blocker apps.
2. Turn off **Private DNS** in your Android settings:
   - Settings → Network & Internet → Private DNS → Select **Off**
3. Restart the app.

⚠️ **This is mandatory. The app will not function correctly if ad blocking or Private DNS is enabled.**
